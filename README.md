# A PERF Trailblazer 🌠

_"No further hesitation / On those unanswered questions / So now, I'll make a dream unchained"_ 

## About Me

I'm working on this [open question](https://doi.org/10.1145/1693453.1693493) right now:

> _"What is the performance of an application X on a parallel machine Y with 10000 nodes connected by network Z?"_

It is pretty easy to call me by my name as it shares the same pronunciation /jiː-hɪn tʃɔŋ/ (IPA) in any language, such as **チョン**·イーヒン in Japanese. My surname, CHONG, usually comes first in East Asian languages.
