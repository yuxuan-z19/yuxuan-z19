# Ex-PERF, LLM codesign newbie

_"No further hesitation / On those unanswered questions / So now, I'll make a dream unchained"_ 

## About Me

Benchmarked neuromorphic systems for 3 years; now wrestling with LLM performance on massive heterogeneous clusters. 
 <!-- _It is pretty easy to pronounce my name, as it shares the same pronunciation /jiː-hɪn tʃɔŋ/ (IPA) in any language, such as **チョン**·イーヒン in Japanese. My surname, CHONG, usually comes first in East Asian languages._ -->
