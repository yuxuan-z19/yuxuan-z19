# A PERF Trailblazer üå†

_"No further hesitation / On those unanswered questions / So now, I'll make a dream unchained"_ 

## About Me

I'm working on this [open question](https://doi.org/10.1145/1693453.1693493) tailored for LLM workloads and heterogeneous clusters:

_**"What is the performance of an application X on a parallel machine Y with 10000 nodes connected by network Z?"**_
